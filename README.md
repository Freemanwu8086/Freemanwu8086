Hello! I'm really glad to have this account that can sharing my code and projects to everyone!
For me, it's a nice chance to learn others code all over the world! I have to say " I LOVE GITHUB!".
I'm major in Java, MySql, Spring, SpringMVC, Mybatis and also a little HTML. I hope that one day I can take down Linux!
